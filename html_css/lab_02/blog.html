            <p><strong><i>Amitabh Bachchan;</i></strong> 
            born in 11 october 1942, is an indian film actor, film producer, television host, occasional playback
            singer and former politician. He is regarded as one of the greatest actors in the history of Indian Cinema.
            He has appeared in over 200 Indian films in a career spanning more than five decades, and has won numerous accoldes in his career,
            including four <em>National Film Awards</em> as Best Actor, Dadasaheb Phalke Award as lifetime achievement award and many awards as international
            film festivals and award cermonies.</p>
            <p>Son of well known poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan and Teji Bachchan. He has a brother named Ajitabh. He completed his education from <br> Uttar Pradesh 
            and moved to Bombay to find work as a film star, in vain though, as film-makers preferred someone with a fairer skin, and he was not quite fair 
            enough. But they did use one of his other assets, his deep baritone voice, which was used for narration and background commentary. He was successful
            in being cast in Saat Hindustani. He got his break in Bollywood after a letter of introduction from the then Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi, as
            he was a friend of her son, Rajiv Gandhi. This is how Amitabh made an entry in Bollywood, starting with Zanjeer, co-starred with his future wife 
            Jaya Bhaduri, and since then there has been no looking back.</p>
            <p>He married Jaya Bhaduri, an accomplished actress in her own right, and they had two children, Shweta and Abhishek. Shweta is married,
            lives a non-filmy life and has two children. </p>

            So Challenge the changes.
            Never change the challenges.</q>
